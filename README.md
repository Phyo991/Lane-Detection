Lane Line Detection for Autonomous Vehicles
 
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a program capable of detecting lane lines in photos and videos, a critical component for enhancing the navigational capabilities of self-driving cars. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, this program interprets visual data similarly to human perception, focusing specifically on identifying road lane markings. The ultimate goal is to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles by enabling them to recognize and follow lane lines independently, reducing the need for human intervention.

Why It Matters

For human drivers, lane lines are essential for guiding navigation and ensuring safe driving practices. Similarly, autonomous vehicles require the ability to 'see' and interpret these lines to navigate roads safely. By developing a robust lane line detection program, we aim to bridge this gap, allowing self-driving cars to better understand their surroundings and make informed decisions on the road.

Technologies Used

Computer Vision: Techniques to process and analyze images and videos to detect lane lines.
OpenCV: An open-source library designed for computer vision tasks, used extensively in this project for image manipulation and processing.
Python: The primary programming language used for developing the detection algorithms.
